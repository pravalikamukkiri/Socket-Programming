for running:
open server directory in a terminal window
	and run 'make server'
open client directory in another terminal window
	and run 'make client'

now open server window and run './server'
open client window and run ./client with either file names as command line arguments or just press enter to get output multiple times.

run 'get <filename> <filename>' in this pattern to get files downloaded

run 'exit' to exit.
